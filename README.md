# Smart Glasses and Stick

There have been several technological advancements and attempts to create products that
would aid visually impaired people. All of these developments were initiated with the objective to
create a society where visually challenged people can lead completely natural lives. We wanted
to contribute to this idealistic goal by creating a gadget that can be used by blind people to
ensure a more comfortable experience in functioning in their day-to-day lives.
It is common knowledge that traveling is a difficult ordeal for people that are visually impaired.
Moreover, performing daily activities in a smooth fashion turns out to be a cumbersome
experience. To solve this, we decided to come up with a combination of two products as an
aided set : Namely, ‘smart goggles’ and ‘smart stick’. Both of these products would make use of
a voice assistant to communicate with the user.

**Expected Outcomes:**
**Smart Goggles **: This is a form of goggles, intended to be worn by the user whenever
he/she is traveling outside. This would help the user by:
1. Recognizing faces known by the user by referencing an already existent set of
the facial database created by the user.

2. Detecting any obstacle present above the waist level of the user(upto 2m ahead
of the user) which is not usually detected by regular canes.

**Smart stick :** Shaped like a regular cane, this would be carried by the user in place of a
normal blind man’s cane and would be used to:
1. Navigate through the streets using GPS.
2. Detect obstacles located below the waist. (upto 0.5m ahead of the user)

**Additional features:**
● A buzzer would be incorporated with the set that would be activated by the user
voice. This would help the user in finding the gadgets in case of misplacing any
of the article.
The proposed expected outcome for our smart goggles + smart stick combo is to produce sustainable products so that visually impaired folks
get access to an economical and comfortable object so as to measure their way of life well. In
an exceedingly developing country like India, there's a desire for a value-effective resolution so
most of the folks will have an effective product in hand. Thus via exploitation of such good
technology we tend to aim to assist visually impaired folks for his or her profit.
